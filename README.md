# Skills

A shared skills repository for AI-assisted workflows. Not tied to any single product or team — if a workflow can be packaged as a skill, it belongs here.

> 👐 **Everyone is welcome to contribute skills they've refined.**
> A good skill = one person figures out the workflow + the whole team saves time forever.

## Creating a Skill

Use the [template](template/SKILL.md) as a starting point:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it.
---

# My Skill Name

[Instructions that Claude follows when this skill is active]

## Examples
- Example usage 1
- Example usage 2

## Guidelines
- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
```

For complex skills, use the eval-and-iterate workflow: draft → test against real tasks → refine description and instructions → repeat until the skill triggers correctly and produces consistent output.

```

### Frontmatter Requirements

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | ✅ | Unique kebab-case identifier |
| `description` | ✅ | When to trigger + what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism — include both positive triggers ("use when...") and negative triggers ("do NOT use when...") |

### Tips

- **Description is everything**: Claude decides whether to load your skill based solely on the `description` field. Be specific about trigger contexts.
- **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines**: Long content goes into `references/`, linked from SKILL.md.
- **When to use / when NOT to use**: Negative trigger lists prevent false activations.
- **Include worked examples**: A concrete example prevents more misinvocations than pages of abstract rules.
- **Version your references**: If a skill has persistent state (like style profiles), document the storage format.

## Contributing

1. Prototype locally in `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`
2. Copy to `skills/<name>/` in this repo
3. Add to the Skill Catalog table in this README (pick the right category)
4. Open a PR

### Naming Conventions

- Directory names: `kebab-case`, verb-first (`test-and-report`, `doc-review`, `wechat-crm`)
- PRs go through review, merges use squash
- Breaking changes: write a CHANGELOG entry; if trigger phrases change, flag in PR description
